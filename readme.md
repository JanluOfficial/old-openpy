## What is OpenPy?
OpenPy is a Command Line Interface Built on Python. It allows the user to run Python Apps both from the opr-library repository (aka. over the cloud) without having to locally save it, as well as locally saved Python Apps.

Developers are also able to build Apps with OpenPy's Included API's. (Comming soon)

## Download
Unfortunately, to download OpenPy at the moment (the moment I'm writing this), you will have to download the source code... If there is a release in the releases section of this Github Repository, please download that one instead.
